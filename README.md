# bachelor_weather

This App is meant to be a Project in which I use different state management methods to render the Same UI,
The findings will be part of a paper I am currently writing for my Studies.

The App will display a small amount of weather data using the Redux Package, Inherited Widgets, Providers and Bussines Logic Components (BLoCs).
